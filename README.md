# Explainable Garment's Workers Productivity Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorthms & SHAP

●	It is a regression problem

●   Various feature engineering techniques such as outlier detection and removal, encoding and scaling has been implemented.

●   8 Machine Learning Algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM etc have been used for training.

●   Random Forest algorithm gives the best perfomance.

●   Lastly, an Explainable AI technique called SHAP is used to explain the blackbox.
